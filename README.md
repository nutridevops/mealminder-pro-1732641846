## Technical Architecture

### API Endpoints

#### Health Service API
```typescript
// Food Analysis
POST /api/health/analyze
POST /api/health/meal-analysis
GET /api/health/user-metrics/:userId

// Health Tracking
POST /api/health/metrics
GET /api/health/progress/:userId
```

#### Chat Service API
```typescript
// Conversation Management
POST /api/chat/conversation
POST /api/chat/order-processing
POST /api/chat/health-guidance
```

### Service Communication Patterns

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- Event types for user preferences, location changes, and health metrics
- Centralized event bus implementation
- Service integration layer for cross-service communication

#### Service Integration
- Health service integration for real-time analysis
- Location service integration for venue recommendations
- Chat service integration for contextual responses

### Scaling and Monitoring Strategy

#### Infrastructure Scaling
```yaml
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
minReplicas: 2
maxReplicas: 10
metrics:
  - cpu: 70%
  - memory: 80%
```

#### Monitoring Implementation
- Performance metrics tracking
- Health checks for all services
- Distributed tracing
- Structured logging
- Real-time alerting

#### Load Balancing
- Round-robin/least-connections algorithms
- Health check monitoring
- SSL termination
- Rate limiting
